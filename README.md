# Jotihunt.app
Jotihunt.app sends location data to Jotihunt.js.
## Set and build
Edit `HOST_ADDRESS` in /jotihunt.js/src/main/java/nl/tristandb/lamp/app/jotihuntapp/jotihuntjs to your own server.
Build using Gradle and upload the file to your own Android device.

## Extra information
Location data will be send every minute (even if the phone is on standby). Authentication can be done by credentials, or by scanning a qr-code from the Jotihunt.js app.
